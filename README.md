software architecture assignment cameronmgj
tournament system producing table of processed data about competitors with gui

gui run by manager class - intended for users
terminal ui run by tournamentUI class - increased access to methods but unstable
viewing 'level' (stored in each competitor instance) does not update if value changed in gui - due to inheritance, assignment brief stated it would be an issue so has been left as is
